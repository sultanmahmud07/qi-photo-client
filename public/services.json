    "description": "Portrait photography is a very well-known and popular style of photography. This style of photography is all about trying to capture the personality, identity, soul, and emotions of a person by utilizing the background atmosphere, poses, and lighting. In portrait photography the background is just as important as the subject. A busy or distracting background will take attention away from the person in your photo. Usually for portrait photography you'll want a neutral, uncluttered background that won't distract the viewer from your portrait subject.",

It should feel personal to the story,” says Lopez. You want the imagery to be an extension of the story, so be sure to follow your shot list and stick to your plan. Traditionally, editorial photography means the images that accompany an article in a publication. But editorial images can also exist on their own and imply a narrative or outline a creative concept.",
